    \section{Implementación del método de Random Projections para el corpus
generado por los artículos del 2016 del New York
Times}\label{implementaciuxf3n-del-muxe9todo-de-random-projections-para-el-corpus-generado-por-los-artuxedculos-del-2016-del-new-york-times}

A continuación se implementará el método propuesto en este
\href{./random-indexing-dr-explained.pdf}{paper}.

    La idea es generar la matriz \(M'_{p*m}\) a partir de la matriz
\(M_{p*n}\) y la matriz de proyecciones \(R_{n*m}\). Donde:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  p = cantidad de documentos
\item
  n = cantidad de palabras en el vocabulario
\item
  m = cantidad de tópicos
\end{itemize}

La matriz \(M\) contiene una fila por documento y una columna por cáda
término dentro del vocabulario. El elemento \(M_{i,j}\) contendrá una
medida de la cantidad de veces que aparece el término \(j\) en el
documento \(i\). Para nuestro caso, esa medida será el tfidf. La matriz
\(M\) es sparsa ya que para un documento en particular, la gran mayoría
de las palabras no aparecerá.

La matriz \(M'\) contiene una fila por documento y una columna por cada
tópico. El elemento \(M'_{i,j}\) contiene una medida de cuánto aporta el
tópico \(j\) a la construcción del documento \(i\).

El método propuesto por el paper consta en:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Construcción de la matriz \(M_{p*n}\) a partir del corpus generado por
  los artículos del New York Times del 2016. Esto se hará en un script
  de Python aparte para no ensuciar con código secundario esta notebook.
\item
  Generación de la matriz de proyección \(R\). Mas adelante se dará un
  detalle de la generación de esta matriz.
\item
  Cálculo de la matriz \(M'\) como la proyección definida por \(R\) de
  la matriz \(M\) en el espacio de menor dimensión.
\end{enumerate}

Una vez calculada esta transformación, podremos hacer el siguiente
análisis:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Tomar un palabra en particular del vocabulario (como un documento en
  el espacio de dimensión n cuyas componentes son todas cero salvo la
  componente que representa la palabra elegida que vale uno),
  transformarla con R y recuperar los k documentos vecinos.
\item
  Tomar varias palabras del vocabulario (mismo procedimiento que el
  anterior, pero con más componentes en uno), transformarlas con R y
  recuperar los k documentos vecinos a este vector en el espacio de
  dimensión reducida.
\item
  Tomar documentos de referencia de \(M'\) y buscar sus k documentos mas
  cercanos en el espacio de dimensión reducida.
\end{enumerate}

Para cada punto definido anteriormente, se puede hacer una evaluación
cualitativa de los resultados. ** Discutir un mecanismo de evaluación
cuantitativo.**

    \section{\texorpdfstring{Construcción de la matriz
\(M\)}{Construcción de la matriz M}}\label{construcciuxf3n-de-la-matriz-m}

Para construir la matriz \(M\) se utilizarán los artículos extraídos en
esta
\href{./Corpus\%20que\%20se\%20utilizará\%20para\%20la\%20comparación\%20de\%20métodos.ipynb}{notebook}.

Primero se cargarán los artículos y luego se construirá la matriz \(M\)
utilizando el paquete tfidf de sklearn.

It's been nearly 35 years since Frank Sinatra played the Great White Way, but Ol' Blue Eyes is back: the singer's music and voice will return to Broadway in a Twyla Tharp musical that its producers said on Monday will transfer to the Marquis Theater later this year. The musical, which is conceived, choreographed and directed by Ms. Tharp, was previously titled "Come Fly With Me" when it was presented at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta last fall, but will be called "Come Fly Away" for its Broadway run. (The show's press representatives did not immediately offer an explanation for the name change, you dig?) Casting for "Come Fly Away" was not announced; it is to begin previews at the Marquis on March 1 and open on March 25. Mr. Sinatra's only previous Broadway credit, according to ibdb.com, was a 1975 concert performed at the Uris Theater with Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie. Ms. Tharp ("Movin' Out") has previously used Mr. Sinatra's music in her dance pieces "Once More Frank," "Nine Sinatra Songs" and "Sinatra Suite."

Mr. Allina, who helped bring the world the modern Pez dispenser, was 87. The cause was heart failure, his son, Johnny, said.

Talks between the players and management of the Cleveland Orchestra broke down on Wednesday, and the musicians threatened to go on strike on Jan. 18. That is the day before the orchestra is to leave for a residency in Miami. “That tour is in question,” Jeffrey Rathbun, the orchestra’s assistant principal oboist and the musicians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement. The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive. Our musicians are going to leave for greener pastures.”.

As “Avatar” knocks down box office records, the film has hit another, less estimable milestone: it has become the fastest-pirated movie, according to one tracking firm’s figures. The Times of London reported that “Avatar,” starring Zoë Saldana, right, was illegally downloaded 500,000 times in the first two days of its release and 980,000 times in the first week, citing figures from the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks usage of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent. In the days leading up to the film’s release last month, its director, James Cameron, seemed confident that the 3-D effects would essentially make it immune to piracy, telling The Times of London, “You can pirate a 3-D movie, but you can’t pirate it in 3-D, so you can’t bottle that 3-D experience.” But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: “Avatar” was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the “Twilight” sequel “New Moon,” which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released “Avatar,” seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed \$1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. “Bootleg copies are unlikely to have much impact,” a studio spokesman told The Times of London. “Seeing the movie in 3-D in a cinema offers an experience that cannot be replicated.”.

Before the Ravens lost to the Patriots on Oct. 4, their offense was being hailed as nearly the explosive equal of the Patriots', which to that point had struggled. The game was close -- a 27-21 Patriots victory -- but it sent Baltimore into a tailspin, largely because of its defense. The Ravens lost three in a row. Their offense has not been the same since, either, scoring big only against leaky defenses like the Lions' and the Bears'. No matter their record, is there any team that makes opponents more nervous in January than the Patriots? New England had looked to be rounding into playoff form, but losing receiver Wes Welker to a season-ending knee injury is devastating. The Ravens can focus on stopping Randy Moss. The Patriots have had problems with their secondary, and the pass rush has been less than effective against elite quarterbacks. If the Patriots can get a lead, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco will be on the run. Still, this is not the Patriots' best team by a long shot, and even if they get past the Ravens, Indianapolis and San Diego could scorch the secondary.

THE NEWS The world's tallest building, the 160-story, 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa, officially opened in Dubai. BEHIND THE NEWS Begun five years ago at the height of a boom in Dubai, the tower opened at a bad time. Long the brash striver among the United Arab Emirates, Dubai in recent months has been so beset by debts and a real estate crash that it turned to Abu Dhabi for a \$10 billion bailout loan -- and then renamed the building, begun as the Burj Dubai, in honor of the emir of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Burj's apartments and commercial space are said to be 90 percent sold, but at a cost: some other premium buildings in Dubai are lying half-empty.

The Tony Award-winning actor Norbert Leo Butz (below, in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”) has been cast in the role of Jeffrey Skilling, the disgraced former president of Enron Corporation, in the coming Broadway production of Lucy Prebble’s play “Enron.” Mr. Butz was last seen on Broadway as Bobby Gould in the 2008-9 revival of David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow.” “Enron,” which has been running to acclaim in London, was inspired by the financial collapse of the energy company whose name has become synonymous with corporate fraud. Many of the characters — like Mr. Skilling and Kenneth Lay — are based on former employees of Enron. (Mr. Lay was its chairman.) Directed by Rupert Goold, “Enron” is scheduled to begin previews at the Broadhurst Theater April 8 and open April 27.

According to Guinness World Records, the world's most expensive perfume is the designer Clive Christian's limited edition No. 1, at \$250,000 for a 50-milliliter bottle. That's fine, but all that really matters is whether his scents are any good. Set aside No. 1 Imperial Majesty (\$215,000 for 500 milliliters) and Monogram (\$14,500 for 30 milliliters), and we're left with three Clive Christian masculines, all of which are slightly offbeat and rather good.X For Men, created by the talented avant-garde perfumer Geza Schoen under Christian's direction and launched in 2001, has one of the strangest drydowns I've ever experienced. It starts out as a delightful retro, channeling the aftershave used decades ago in Italian barbershops - delicious, aromatic pine with bark of burnished cinnamon. About five hours later, after that burns off, the scent that remains is neutral human breath, warm and strange - and incredibly, almost upsettingly intimate. The barber is inches away, squinting as he trims your sideburns. If you find that he's a bit too close, simply reapply after a few hours and the '50s-era pine will return and endure.

Normal scissors aren't sharp enough to cut through the packaging, and attacking the plastic with a knife could have disastrous consequences.

The Tony Award-winning actor Norbert Leo Butz (below, in “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”) has been cast in the role of Jeffrey Skilling, the disgraced former president of Enron Corporation, in the coming Broadway production of Lucy Prebble’s play “Enron.” Mr. Butz was last seen on Broadway as Bobby Gould in the 2008-9 revival of David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow.” “Enron,” which has been running to acclaim in London, was inspired by the financial collapse of the energy company whose name has become synonymous with corporate fraud. Many of the characters — like Mr. Skilling and Kenneth Lay — are based on former employees of Enron. (Mr. Lay was its chairman.) Directed by Rupert Goold, “Enron” is scheduled to begin previews at the Broadhurst Theater April 8 and open April 27.

The Palm Springs International Film Festival confirmed that two Chinese movies had been pulled from its lineup and would be replaced. The films, “City of Life and Death” (also called “Nanjing! Nanjing!”) and “Quick, Quick, Slow,” were withdrawn from the festival by China’s foreign affairs ministry and its film bureau in protest of another film, “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom.” That film, a documentary, chronicles a year in the life of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. In a statement Darryl Macdonald, the director of the festival, said the films were withdrawn when the festival did not comply with a request from the Chinese to cancel screenings of “The Sun Behind the Clouds.” He added: “We cannot allow the concerns of one country or community to dictate what films we should or should not play, based on their own cultural or political perspective.” The festival said “City of Life and Death,” with Liu Ye, above, in a scene from the film, would be replaced with screenings of “For a Moment, Freedom,” an Austrian and French film about Middle Eastern refugees seeking European visas; and “Sticky Fingers,” a Canadian, French and Spanish comedy about inept gangsters. A replacement for “Quick, Quick, Slow” has not yet been announced.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two Chinese movies have been pulled from the Palm Springs International Film Festival in California to protest another film about the Dalai Lama and Tibet, Agence France-Presse reported. The Chinese movies “Nanjing! Nanjing!” (also known as “City of Life and Death”), about the Japanese occupation of Nanjing in 1937, and “Quick Quick Slow Slow,” a short film, were withdrawn, according to China’s state-run Beijing Times, because the festival plans to screen a movie called “The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet’s Struggle for Freedom.” That film, a documentary by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, follows the Dalai Lama for a year, and its description in the festival’s program said that it chronicled “the 2008 protests in Tibet, the long march in India, the Beijing Olympics and the breakdown of talks with China.” The Beijing Times called the movie a “Tibetan independence” film. A representative for “Nanjing! Nanjing!” said that the films were pulled on the order of China’s ministry of foreign affairs, its film bureau and the consulate general of China in Los Angeles.

Talks between the players and management of the Cleveland Orchestra broke down on Wednesday, and the musicians threatened to go on strike on Jan. 18. That is the day before the orchestra is to leave for a residency in Miami. “That tour is in question,” Jeffrey Rathbun, the orchestra’s assistant principal oboist and the musicians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement. The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive. Our musicians are going to leave for greener pastures.”.

China is withdrawing two films from the Palm Springs International Film Festival in protest of a scheduled screening of a documentary about Tibet and the Dalai Lama.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated | 3:44 p.m. Two Chinese movies have been pulled from the Palm Springs International Film Festival to protest another film about the Dalai Lama and Tibet, Agence France-Presse reported. The Chinese movies "Nanjing! Nanjing!" (also known as "City of Life and Death"), about the Japanese occupation of Nanjing in 1937, and "Quick Quick Slow," were withdrawn, according to China's state-run Beijing Times, because the Palm Springs festival plans to screen a movie called "The Sun Behind the Clouds: Tibet's Struggle for Freedom." That film, a documentary by Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam, follows the Dalai Lama for a year, and its description in the festival's program said that it chronicled "the 2008 protests in Tibet, the long march in India, the Beijing Olympics and the breakdown of talks with China." A representative for "Nanjing! Nanjing!" said that the films were pulled on the order of China's ministry of foreign affairs, its film bureau and the consulate general of China in Los Angeles.

A report in the Prescriptions column on Friday about Senator Ben Nelson\&\#8217;s role in negotiations over the Senate health care bill referred incorrectly to his position on Medicaid costs. Mr. Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat, told Senate leaders he opposed an increase in his state\&\#8217;s Medicaid costs, and suggested that all states be allowed to opt out of a proposed Medicaid expansion. Senate leaders proposed that the federal government pick up Nebraska\&\#8217;s full share of the new Medicaid costs, and Mr. Nelson agreed. He did not demand that the federal government cover those costs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Senator Ben Nelson, below, Democrat of Nebraska, on Friday asked the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, to remove a special provision in the health care legislation that would have the federal government pay all the costs for a proposed expansion of Medicaid in Nebraska. The provision was added to the Senate version of the legislation to help secure Mr. Nelson's vote after he expressed concerns about the cost of the expansion. Under the Senate bill, the federal government would pick up the full cost of the expansion for three years, after which states would have to pay a small portion of the expense.

THE NEWS The world's tallest building, the 160-story, 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa, officially opened in Dubai. BEHIND THE NEWS Begun five years ago at the height of a boom in Dubai, the tower opened at a bad time. Long the brash striver among the United Arab Emirates, Dubai in recent months has been so beset by debts and a real estate crash that it turned to Abu Dhabi for a \$10 billion bailout loan -- and then renamed the building, begun as the Burj Dubai, in honor of the emir of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Burj's apartments and commercial space are said to be 90 percent sold, but at a cost: some other premium buildings in Dubai are lying half-empty.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world\&\#8217;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a \$10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates.

Millburn Police are asking for the public's assistance in an investigation by the Millburn Detective Bureau into the theft of an \$18,000 sable coat from Saks Fifth Avenue at the Mall at Short Hills on Saturday (Jan. 9).

The employee took the coat from the woman and started to call for help when she saw the woman take another coat, described as a "bleached knitted sable coat," and run to the parking deck labeled Teal, Level 1. The suspect got into a black Maxima with two men inside, and they all fled, the woman reported. Anyone with information is asked to call detectives at 973-654-7017.The police reported a number of other shoplifting incidents at the Mall at Short Hills in the last week, but none as costly as the Saks theft. \textasciitilde{}Lois DeSocio

There is a surprisingly fine line between nightmarish and cute. Jeremy Wade toes and then smears it in ''There Is No End to More,'' a solo for Jared Gradinger that returned for a one-night engagement at Japan Society on Monday. Mr. Gradinger collaborated on the direction and choreography with Mr. Wade, an American artist living in Berlin whose acclaimed 2006 work, ''Glory,'' brought him to the attention of Japan Society's artistic director, Yoko Shioya. The resulting commission allowed Mr. Wade to spend time in Japan, where he followed his interest in manga comic books and the country's aesthetic of extreme cuteness.

McHUGH--Peter S.,of New York City died at home on January 5 after a protracted battle with prostate cancer. Born in 1929, Peter spent his youth in Los Angeles. As a young man he took up the family business, working as an actor both on stage and in early television. He often toured summer stock and appeared regularly opposite his father, Frank McHugh, in shows such as Ah, Wilderness. He served in the US Air Force in the Korean War. He studied at Palos Verdes College, UCLA, and earned his Ph.D. in Sociology at Northwestern University. His work as a professor led him from University of Delaware to Columbia University to Goldsmiths, University of London, and finally to York University, Toronto. A frequent contributor to scholarly journals, Peter also authored or co-authored a number of influential books in his field including: Defining The Situation: The Organization of Meaning in Social Interaction, and On The Beginning of Social Inquiry. Peter's love of discourse bestowed those around him with his remarkable curiosity, erudition, charm and well-honed sense of humor. His commitment to close friends and family will be deeply missed. Peter was a devoted husband to the late Patricia, a supportive father to Caitlin and Joshua, and a dear grandfather to Calder. He was a thoroughly dedicated son to his mother, the late Dorothy Spencer McHugh.

In the aftermath of Friday's chilling attack on Togo's national team that left three dead before the start of the African Cup of Nations, South African officials immediately stepped forward in an attempt to separate the events in Angola from concerns about security ahead of the start of the 2010 World Cup in June. ''It has no impact on our World Cup,'' Danny Jordaan, the leader of South Africa's organizing committee, told Reuters on Saturday. ''The world understands that sovereign countries are responsible for their own safety and security, and to say what happened in Angola impacts on the World Cup in South Africa is the same as suggesting that when a bomb goes off in Spain, it threatens London's ability to host the next Olympics.''

The mood at last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was decidedly more upbeat than at the previous year's show. At that exhibition, the chatter on the floor was less about innovation and breakthrough technologies than about how to weather the economic storm that would impede the kind of discretionary spending much of the electronics industry relies on. This year's show was a return to optimism. Tablet-size reading devices and three-dimensional television were two technologies often mentioned when exhibitors talked about future prosperity, but there were also developments in the comparatively mature industries of personal computing and cellphones.

Personal Lives on the Stand | In the first day of the same-sex marriage trial in federal court in San Francisco, Theodore B. Olson asked his client, "What does it mean to be a lesbian?" Two gay couples testified about their lives and their reactions to the 2008 passage of Proposition 8, the state ballot initiative that changed the state's constitution so that gays and lesbians could not marry. Video coverage of the nonjury trial, which addresses the constitutionality of the gay-marriage ban, is not available on YouTube, as had been planned. Hours before the trial began, the United States Supreme halted, for a few days, the plan to show the court proceedings on YouTube until the justices could review the issue of cameras in the court room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal reminiscence and Israeli history are woven into a dense, occasionally impenetrable cinematic poem in Amos Gitai's film ''Carmel,'' whose title refers to the mountains near Haifa, Mr. Gitai's native city. The film begins with a prologue in which Mr. Gitai, pictured in stills, is shown strolling alone on a beach to the strains of a Mahler symphony. Then it abruptly plunges back in time to a crude re-enactment of the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the first century A.D., when the future emperor Titus and his army destroyed the city and its temple. The strife is evoked by dissolving multiple exposures of clashing soldiers as the actress Jeanne Moreau reads from a French translation of an account by the Jewish historian Josephus. The English subtitles, read in the background by an announcer, create an echo-chamber effect that suggests the similarity between then and now. Nearly two millenniums later the weapons of war may be different, but to Mr. Gitai's immense sorrow and frustration, the same kind of savagery persists.

There is a surprisingly fine line between nightmarish and cute. Jeremy Wade toes and then smears it in ''There Is No End to More,'' a solo for Jared Gradinger that returned for a one-night engagement at Japan Society on Monday. Mr. Gradinger collaborated on the direction and choreography with Mr. Wade, an American artist living in Berlin whose acclaimed 2006 work, ''Glory,'' brought him to the attention of Japan Society's artistic director, Yoko Shioya. The resulting commission allowed Mr. Wade to spend time in Japan, where he followed his interest in manga comic books and the country's aesthetic of extreme cuteness.

The actor Santino Fontana, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in the new Broadway revival of "A View From the Bridge," said in a statement on Wednesday that he was leaving the show in order to make a full recovery from an onstage injury over New Year's weekend that led to a concussion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actor Santino Fontana, below, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in previews of the Broadway revival of “A View From the Bridge,” said he was leaving the show to make a full recovery from an onstage injury that resulted in a concussion. His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” Mr. Fontana worked under Mr. Mosher in “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” the Broadway revival that closed a week after opening in the fall. “View” is to open Jan. 24.

For those of you keeping score at home, the list of people, groups and nations that do not like "Avatar" include social and political conservatives; anticolonialists; antismoking advocates; the Vatican and China. To that list of detractors you can now add Russian filmgoers, who say the James Cameron movie too closely resembles a literary science-fiction series by the authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The Guardian has reported that the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda ran an article on Monday comparing "Avatar" to the Strugatskys' "Noon Universe" books: both take place in the 22nd century on Pandora, and the alien species in "Avatar" is called the Na'vi, while "Noon Universe" chronicles a race called the Nave. In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of "Avatar" were "unequivocally reminiscent" of the "Noon Universe" novels, and told The Guardian that "the film is harmful for western civilization." But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen "Avatar," and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism.

Saudi Arabia's assistant defense minister, Prince Khaled bin Sultan, said Tuesday that Saudi forces had killed hundreds of Yemeni rebels who had occupied a border village, as fighting between the rebels and Yemen's military also intensified nearby in the Yemen city of Sadah. The developments signaled a concerted push by the Saudi and Yemeni governments to try to end a continuing conflict that has flared into all-out war since the summer. The conflict between Yemen and the Houthi rebels, named after the clan of their leader, also spilled over the border into Saudi Arabia, prompting Saudi forces to begin their own offensive on Nov. 4 to push the rebels back.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yemen's Houthi rebels offered a truce to Saudi Arabia on Monday, after three months of fighting on the remote border of the two countries. In an audio recording posted on the Internet, the Houthi rebel leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, said the truce was intended to avoid bloodshed and civilian deaths. But he added that the rebels would wage ''open war'' if Saudi Arabia did not end its hostilities. Saudi Arabia has lost at least 113 soldiers in the conflict, according to Saudi officials. The Saudis became involved in early November, when Houthi fighters shot and killed a Saudi border guard.

Since then, Arenas has pleaded guilty to a felony charge of carrying an unlicensed pistol. Sentencing is scheduled for March 26, and it is unlikely the league will act before then to change his current indefinite suspension.

For a guy who earned his reputation by joking about popular culture, Aziz Ansari has done a pretty good job of insinuating himself into it. From his standup routines about his way-out explorations of Facebook and Craigslist or his love of musicians like R. Kelly and the Wu-Tang Clan, Mr. Ansari, 26, has leaped into a film and television career: he appeared in the Judd Apatow movie "Funny People" as an annoyingly successful comedian named Randy (or, as the character prefers, Raaaaaaaandy!); and he's a star of the NBC sitcom "Parks and Recreation," on which he plays the suave yet lazy government worker Tom Haverford. To his own astonishment, he has also become a friend of Kanye West, and once hung out in the rapper's apartment (where they listened to Mr. West's music).

Letters, journals and other correspondence written by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, below left, over the course of his half-century career in public service will be published this year. On Wednesday, PublicAffairs said it would release a book culled from more than 10,000 pages of letters written by Mr. Moynihan, the former senator from New York, during his time on Capitol Hill and in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. In an e-mail message, PublicAffairs said the letters in the book, which does not yet have a title, would cover the 1950s to Mr. Moynihan’s death in 2003, and would reveal his thoughts on matters including the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, health care, urban planning and the United Nations. Among the noteworthy recipients of Mr. Moynihan’s correspondence were Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Indira Gandhi, Chaim Herzog, William F. Buckley Jr. and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The book is to be edited by Steven R. Weisman, a former staff member of The New York Times, who is now the editorial director and public policy fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

The actor Santino Fontana, below, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in previews of the Broadway revival of “A View From the Bridge,” said he was leaving the show to make a full recovery from an onstage injury that resulted in a concussion. His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” Mr. Fontana worked under Mr. Mosher in “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” the Broadway revival that closed a week after opening in the fall. “View” is to open Jan. 24.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even bogus boxing can be hazardous on a Broadway stage. Santino Fontana, who plays the young suitor Rodolpho in the current Broadway production of "A View From the Bridge," remains out of the show since sustaining a minor concussion from a boxing scene with Liev Schreiber's character during a performance New Year's weekend. Mr. Fontana left the show temporarily under doctor's orders, according to a statement on Thursday from a publicist for the show, and he was scheduled to still be off for Monday night's performance. It is not clear when he will return. The role of Rodolpho is being played by the understudy, Morgan Spector. Mr. Fontana sustained the concussion during a scene in which Rodolpho is drawn into sparring by Eddie Carbone (Mr. Schreiber), the jealous uncle of Rodolpho's love interest, Catherine (Scarlett Johansson). No one from the production was available to comment on Monday about Mr. Fontana's health or whether the boxing scene has been re-choreographed, the publicist said.

What's in a Name? | The lawyer, Jesse Jackson, 79, who owns the privately held Jackson Family Wines, wants to change the name of Black Mountain, a 3,128-foot-high peak a few miles east of Geyserville, to Alexander Mountain. Mr. Jackson's company is also seeking to create a new wine named Alexander Mountain, which, if approved, would permit the company to put a special label on the premium wine it makes from grapes grown at the base of the mountain. Area residents are not sympathetic, and a movement has formed against the change.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about renaming a mountain in Sonoma County referred incorrectly to plans by a winemaker to change the name of Black Mountain, an area outside of Geyserville, to Alexander Mountain. The winemaker, Jess Jackson , wants to use the name for a new wine appellation — not for a new wine. (An Alexander Mountain wine already exists.).

Fashion is showing the sobering effects of the recession in a very positive way. The inexpensive and lightweight puffy down coats that have been around for decades have taken sophisticated new shapes, often in licorice black and in fabrics that resemble ciré (top row). During the holiday season, these shiny-surface coats were a favorite of European visitors -- and one tiny dog. Others prefer a matte finish (bottom row). There are cocoons, capes, pillow collars, baby dolls and even a jacket with a bustle back. Young people have completely embraced down, while their mothers, accustomed to winter furs, continue with pelts.

The Indianapolis Colts probably will not hold up Saturday night's game as a monument to avoiding rust during a playoff bye week, considering that Ed Reed improbably intercepted Peyton Manning twice on the same third-quarter drive. But after nearly a month at the center of the debate about whether teams should rest their starters in meaningless games -- and whether their own history of shaky playoff performances suggested they made the wrong choice -- the Colts provided the answer: this time, it worked for them. The Colts beat the Baltimore Ravens, 20-3, in a somnolent American Football Conference divisional round game, the first time in four tries in the Manning era they have won a playoff game after having a first-round bye. As the conference's top seed, they will host the winner of the Chargers-Jets game next Sunday in the A.F.C. Championship game for the right to go to the Super Bowl.

Dr. Petty was a pulmonologist whose research was instrumental in the development of long-term oxygen therapy for patients with severe chronic lung disease.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Dr. Thomas L. Petty started his research into severe chronic lung disease in the mid-1960s, oxygen therapy was generally administered in hospitals and typically for only a short time. Lung disease experts believed that providing oxygen to pulmonary patients for extended periods would cause a buildup of carbon dioxide in their bloodstreams, making them sicker. But through clinical experiments, Dr. Petty, a pulmonologist, helped demonstrate that providing supplemental oxygen outside the hospital to patients with severe disease improved their energy levels and extended their lives.
