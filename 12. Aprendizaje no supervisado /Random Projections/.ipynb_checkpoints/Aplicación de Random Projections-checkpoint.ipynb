Casting for \"Come Fly Away\" was not announced; it is to begin previews at the Marquis on March 1 and open on March 25. Mr. Sinatra's only previous Broadway credit, according to ibdb.com, was a 1975 concert performed at the Uris Theater with Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie.

Tuberville, who was the coach at Auburn for 10 seasons and the coach at Mississippi for four seasons before that, said in a telephone interview Friday that he hoped to talk with Tech officials next week about replacing Mike Leach as coach. Leach was fired this week after allegations that he had a player, the sophomore receiver Adam James, locked in a closet or shed after James sustained a concussion. Leach has disputed the allegations.\n",

      "Talks between the players and management of the Cleveland Orchestra broke down on Wednesday, and the musicians threatened to go on strike on Jan. 18. That is the day before the orchestra is to leave for a residency in Miami. “That tour is in question,” Jeffrey Rathbun, the orchestra’s assistant principal oboist and the musicians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement. The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive. Our musicians are going to leave for greener pastures.”.\n",

      "As “Avatar” knocks down box office records, the film has hit another, less estimable milestone: it has become the fastest-pirated movie, according to one tracking firm’s figures. The Times of London reported that “Avatar,” starring Zoë Saldana, right, was illegally downloaded 500,000 times in the first two days of its release and 980,000 times in the first week, citing figures from the Web site TorrentFreak.com, which tracks usage of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent. In the days leading up to the film’s release last month, its director, James Cameron, seemed confident that the 3-D effects would essentially make it immune to piracy, telling The Times of London, “You can pirate a 3-D movie, but you can’t pirate it in 3-D, so you can’t bottle that 3-D experience.” But the TorrentFreak.com numbers seem to tell a different story: “Avatar” was illegally downloaded far more often than its closest competitor, the “Twilight” sequel “New Moon,” which was downloaded 610,000 times in its first week of release. Still, 20th Century Fox, which released “Avatar,” seemed unconcerned that piracy would hurt box office grosses, which last weekend surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. “Bootleg copies are unlikely to have much impact,” a studio spokesman told The Times of London. “Seeing the movie in 3-D in a cinema offers an experience that cannot be replicated.”.\n",

      "Before the Ravens lost to the Patriots on Oct. 4, their offense was being hailed as nearly the explosive equal of the Patriots', which to that point had struggled. The game was close -- a 27-21 Patriots victory -- but it sent Baltimore into a tailspin, largely because of its defense. The Ravens lost three in a row. Their offense has not been the same since, either, scoring big only against leaky defenses like the Lions' and the Bears'. No matter their record, is there any team that makes opponents more nervous in January than the Patriots? New England had looked to be rounding into playoff form, but losing receiver Wes Welker to a season-ending knee injury is devastating. The Ravens can focus on stopping Randy Moss. The Patriots have had problems with their secondary, and the pass rush has been less than effective against elite quarterbacks. If the Patriots can get a lead, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco will be on the run. Still, this is not the Patriots' best team by a long shot, and even if they get past the Ravens, Indianapolis and San Diego could scorch the secondary.\n",

Long the brash striver among the United Arab Emirates, Dubai in recent months has been so beset by debts and a real estate crash that it turned to Abu Dhabi for a $10 billion bailout loan -- and then renamed the building, begun as the Burj Dubai, in honor of the emir of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Burj's apartments and commercial space are said to be 90 percent sold, but at a cost: some other premium buildings in Dubai are lying half-empty.\n",

About five hours later, after that burns off, the scent that remains is neutral human breath, warm and strange - and incredibly, almost upsettingly intimate.

In a statement Darryl Macdonald, the director of the festival, said the films were withdrawn when the festival did not comply with a request from the Chinese to cancel screenings of “The Sun Behind the Clouds.” He added: “We cannot allow the concerns of one country or community to dictate what films we should or should not play, based on their own cultural or political perspective.” The festival said “City of Life and Death,” with Liu Ye, above, in a scene from the film, would be replaced with screenings of “For a Moment, Freedom,” an Austrian and French film about Middle Eastern refugees seeking European visas; and “Sticky Fingers,” a Canadian, French and Spanish comedy about inept gangsters.

That is the day before the orchestra is to leave for a residency in Miami. “That tour is in question,” Jeffrey Rathbun, the orchestra’s assistant principal oboist and the musicians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement. The players’ contract expired at the end of August, but they have agreed to continue rehearsing and performing. Management, citing salary cuts among staff members and the music director, Franz Welser-Möst, above, offered a three-year contract calling for a 5 percent cut in the first year, a restoration of that amount in the second and a 2.5 percent increase in the third. “We need the union to recognize the shared sacrifice throughout the institution and respond in kind,” Gary Hanson, the orchestra’s executive director, said in a statement. The players offered a salary freeze for this year. A spokesman for the players, Howard C. Landau, said they had made concessions in the past, “which is why we keep slipping in the rankings” in relation to salaries at other orchestras. “We just can’t keep slipping any further,” he added. “There’s no way we can stay competitive.

      "THE NEWS The world's tallest building, the 160-story, 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa, officially opened in Dubai. BEHIND THE NEWS Begun five years ago at the height of a boom in Dubai, the tower opened at a bad time. Long the brash striver among the United Arab Emirates, Dubai in recent months has been so beset by debts and a real estate crash that it turned to Abu Dhabi for a $10 billion bailout loan -- and then renamed the building, begun as the Burj Dubai, in honor of the emir of Abu Dhabi, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Burj's apartments and commercial space are said to be 90 percent sold, but at a cost: some other premium buildings in Dubai are lying half-empty.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "An article on Tuesday about the opening of the world&#8217;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, misstated the position of Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, for whom the tower is named. He is president of the United Arab Emirates, not of Abu Dhabi. (He is emir of Abu Dhabi.) The error also appeared in a picture caption accompanying the article and was repeated in an editorial on Wednesday. The editorial also misstated the beneficiary of a $10 billion loan from Abu Dhabi. It was the emirate of Dubai, not the United Arab Emirates.\n",

The resulting commission allowed Mr. Wade to spend time in Japan, where he followed his interest in manga comic books and the country's aesthetic of extreme cuteness.\n",

      "McHUGH--Peter S.,of New York City died at home on January 5 after a protracted battle with prostate cancer. Born in 1929, Peter spent his youth in Los Angeles. As a young man he took up the family business, working as an actor both on stage and in early television. He often toured summer stock and appeared regularly opposite his father, Frank McHugh, in shows such as Ah, Wilderness. He served in the US Air Force in the Korean War. He studied at Palos Verdes College, UCLA, and earned his Ph.D. in Sociology at Northwestern University. His work as a professor led him from University of Delaware to Columbia University to Goldsmiths, University of London, and finally to York University, Toronto. A frequent contributor to scholarly journals, Peter also authored or co-authored a number of influential books in his field including: Defining The Situation: The Organization of Meaning in Social Interaction, and On The Beginning of Social Inquiry. Peter's love of discourse bestowed those around him with his remarkable curiosity, erudition, charm and well-honed sense of humor. His commitment to close friends and family will be deeply missed. Peter was a devoted husband to the late Patricia, a supportive father to Caitlin and Joshua, and a dear grandfather to Calder. He was a thoroughly dedicated son to his mother, the late Dorothy Spencer McHugh.\n",

      "After weeks of complaints from ticket holders, the producers of the Broadway musical “Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark” announced on Tuesday that they would refund tickets through Ticketmaster for preview performances that had been scheduled to start on Feb. 25 but are now, as expected, canceled. The producers did not provide new dates for previews or an opening night, saying only that a revised schedule would be announced shortly and that they still planned to open the show in 2010. With music by U2’s Bono and the Edge and direction by Julie Taymor (“The Lion King”), “Spider-Man” has been marred by delays after an earlier group of producers was unable to raise the money to produce the show. The production is now expected to cost about $50 million, making it the most expensive in Broadway history.\n",

      "Personal reminiscence and Israeli history are woven into a dense, occasionally impenetrable cinematic poem in Amos Gitai's film ''Carmel,'' whose title refers to the mountains near Haifa, Mr. Gitai's native city. The film begins with a prologue in which Mr. Gitai, pictured in stills, is shown strolling alone on a beach to the strains of a Mahler symphony. Then it abruptly plunges back in time to a crude re-enactment of the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the first century A.D., when the future emperor Titus and his army destroyed the city and its temple. The strife is evoked by dissolving multiple exposures of clashing soldiers as the actress Jeanne Moreau reads from a French translation of an account by the Jewish historian Josephus. The English subtitles, read in the background by an announcer, create an echo-chamber effect that suggests the similarity between then and now. Nearly two millenniums later the weapons of war may be different, but to Mr. Gitai's immense sorrow and frustration, the same kind of savagery persists.\n",

      "The actor Santino Fontana, below, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in previews of the Broadway revival of “A View From the Bridge,” said he was leaving the show to make a full recovery from an onstage injury that resulted in a concussion. His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” Mr. Fontana worked under Mr. Mosher in “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” the Broadway revival that closed a week after opening in the fall. “View” is to open Jan. 24.\n",

In the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Bykov wrote that some elements of \"Avatar\" were \"unequivocally reminiscent\" of the \"Noon Universe\" novels, and told The Guardian that \"the film is harmful for western civilization.\" But The Guardian reported that the surviving Strugatsky brother, Boris, had not yet seen \"Avatar,\" and that he played down any reports that he was accusing Mr. Cameron of plagiarism.\n",

The inexpensive and lightweight puffy down coats that have been around for decades have taken sophisticated new shapes, often in licorice black and in fabrics that resemble ciré (top row). During the holiday season, these shiny-surface coats were a favorite of European visitors -- and one tiny dog. Others prefer a matte finish (bottom row). There are cocoons, capes, pillow collars, baby dolls and even a jacket with a bustle back. Young people have completely embraced down, while their mothers, accustomed to winter furs, continue with pelts.\n",

      "Personal reminiscence and Israeli history are woven into a dense, occasionally impenetrable cinematic poem in Amos Gitai's film ''Carmel,'' whose title refers to the mountains near Haifa, Mr. Gitai's native city. The film begins with a prologue in which Mr. Gitai, pictured in stills, is shown strolling alone on a beach to the strains of a Mahler symphony. Then it abruptly plunges back in time to a crude re-enactment of the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the first century A.D., when the future emperor Titus and his army destroyed the city and its temple. The strife is evoked by dissolving multiple exposures of clashing soldiers as the actress Jeanne Moreau reads from a French translation of an account by the Jewish historian Josephus. The English subtitles, read in the background by an announcer, create an echo-chamber effect that suggests the similarity between then and now. Nearly two millenniums later the weapons of war may be different, but to Mr. Gitai's immense sorrow and frustration, the same kind of savagery persists.\n",

The developments signaled a concerted push by the Saudi and Yemeni governments to try to end a continuing conflict that has flared into all-out war since the summer. The conflict between Yemen and the Houthi rebels, named after the clan of their leader, also spilled over the border into Saudi Arabia, prompting Saudi forces to begin their own offensive on Nov. 4 to push the rebels back.\n",

But he added that the rebels would wage ''open war'' if Saudi Arabia did not end its hostilities. Saudi Arabia has lost at least 113 soldiers in the conflict, according to Saudi officials.

On Wednesday, PublicAffairs said it would release a book culled from more than 10,000 pages of letters written by Mr. Moynihan, the former senator from New York, during his time on Capitol Hill and in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. In an e-mail message, PublicAffairs said the letters in the book, which does not yet have a title, would cover the 1950s to Mr. Moynihan’s death in 2003, and would reveal his thoughts on matters including the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, health care, urban planning and the United Nations. Among the noteworthy recipients of Mr. Moynihan’s correspondence were Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Indira Gandhi, Chaim Herzog, William F. Buckley Jr. and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The book is to be edited by Steven R. Weisman, a former staff member of The New York Times, who is now the editorial director and public policy fellow at the Peter G.

      "The actor Santino Fontana, below, who had been playing the key role of Rodolpho in previews of the Broadway revival of “A View From the Bridge,” said he was leaving the show to make a full recovery from an onstage injury that resulted in a concussion. His understudy, Morgan Spector, who has been standing in since Jan. 7, will take over the role. Rodolpho is an Italian immigrant who has entered the United States illegally and draws the ire of Eddie Carbone (played by Liev Schrieber) for courting his niece (Scarlett Johansson). While Mr. Fontana initially was believed to have been injured in a boxing scene between Rodolpho and Eddie, people involved with the production now say that he suffered the injury in another scene over New Year’s weekend. In the statement, Mr. Fontana said, “Knowing that I would not be fully recovered and able to return until after opening, I’ve chosen to withdraw with great respect to my fellow actors and to my own health.” Gregory Mosher, the director, said in the statement: “Santino is a wonderful actor; we’ll miss him, and we are tremendously grateful for his selflessness in this difficult situation. But I have every confidence in Morgan.” Mr. Fontana worked under Mr. Mosher in “Brighton Beach Memoirs,” the Broadway revival that closed a week after opening in the fall. “View” is to open Jan. 24.\n",

Santino Fontana, who plays the young suitor Rodolpho in the current Broadway production of \"A View From the Bridge,\" remains out of the show since sustaining a minor concussion from a boxing scene with Liev Schreiber's character during a performance New Year's weekend. Mr. Fontana left the show temporarily under doctor's orders, according to a statement on Thursday from a publicist for the show, and he was scheduled to still be off for Monday night's performance. It is not clear when he will return. The role of Rodolpho is being played by the understudy, Morgan Spector. Mr. Fontana sustained the concussion during a scene in which Rodolpho is drawn into sparring by Eddie Carbone (Mr. Schreiber), the jealous uncle of Rodolpho's love interest, Catherine (Scarlett Johansson). No one from the production was available to comment on Monday about Mr. Fontana's health or whether the boxing scene has been re-choreographed, the publicist said.\n",
